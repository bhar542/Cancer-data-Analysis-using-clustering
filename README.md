# Cancer-data-Analysis-using-clustering
In this particular project, we are using a dataset that contains information like 
quality radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean,area_mean,
smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean.
However, before you go ahead and make Clustering, it is advised that you first 
pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise. 
In addition, try various tricks and techniques in order to gain the best accuracy 
in your predictions.
